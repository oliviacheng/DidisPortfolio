  <h1> hi, i'm didi. </h1>
  <p> i’m a mixed breed of aussie and lab. mom says i’m super friendly but she really means that i’m just too hyper. sometimes when i’m excited to meet mom’s friends, i’ll pee on them. no one has peed on me back though, so i guess mom’s friends are a bit rude.</p>
  <p> mom said she made this for me to practice her html/css (don’t know what that means), but i know she’s just obsessed with me. she always says i stink but how would she know if she wasn’t smelling me all the time? </p>
  <p> anyways, thanks for stopping by! i’d love a pat from you someday. bye for now! </p>
